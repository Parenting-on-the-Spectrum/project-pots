# Parenting on the Spectrum

Parenting on the spectrum aims to be a complete resource guide for parents with ASD children.
We hope to help out families in the ASD community, and bring both professional and personal experience.

As a father of 2 ASD boys, I felt that finding places to take my kids for services, videos that would benefit them, and videos that would teach me were always scarce. I knew that I wasn't alone in my struggles. That's why we created Parenting on the Spectrum. We have firsthand experience with ASD, and hope to help other families that feel lost.
